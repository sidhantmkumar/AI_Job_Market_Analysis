Methodology Notes – AI Job Market Analysis

Day 1 – Raw Data Understanding

Imported two datasets: ai_job_dataset.xlsx and jobdatasetproseed.xlsx.

Performed column inspection and identified mismatched schemas.

Documented data types, missing values, and duplicate entries.

Day 2 – Data Cleaning & Transformation

Removed duplicates and nulls using Excel and Python.

Standardized column names (snake_case).

Replaced “NA” placeholders and handled inconsistent experience text.

Saved cleaned datasets as CSV: ai_job_dataset_cleaned.csv, jobs_market.csv.

Day 3 – Database Creation

Imported both cleaned files into SQLite.

Defined primary and foreign keys, joined datasets into a master table job_analysis.

Validated relationships using ER diagrams.

Exported combined table and ran queries for salary insights, remote ratios, etc.

Captured SQL query screenshots for documentation.

Day 4 – Power BI Dashboard Development

Imported job_analysis.csv into Power BI.

Built 4-page report:

Overview – KPIs and salary insights.

Company & Remote Trends – Remote vs. on-site analysis.

Industry & Role Analysis – Avg salary by role/industry.

Detailed Table View – Clean tabular reference with slicers.

Added visual theme, slicers, filters, and background for clarity.

Day 5 – Data Analysis with Python

Used Pandas for descriptive statistics and outlier detection.

Created visualizations: salary histograms, job role bar charts, and remote ratio distributions.

Exported results and screenshots for inclusion in analysis outputs.

Day 6 – Regression & Model Evaluation

Implemented Linear Regression to estimate salary trends based on features.

Computed RMSE and R² scores to validate model accuracy.

Saved notebook (Advance_Job_Analysis_using_Python.ipynb) and outputs for reproducibility.

Deliverables:

Cleaned CSV files

SQLite database with joins

Power BI Dashboard (.pbix and PDF)

Python Analysis Notebook (.ipynb)
